## about-the-project
I created a linter for ruby files (files.rb) using Ruby.

The goals of this project are:

- Practice with OOP (Object Oriented Programming) using Ruby.
- Learn how to create and structure a Ruby project.
- Learn to manage the files with correct usage to make code maintainable.
- Practice Git Flow and Github Flow creating branches for different features and for version control.
- Practice to use of regex.
- Learn how to read whole files.
